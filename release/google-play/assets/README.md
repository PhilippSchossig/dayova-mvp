# Google Play asset manifest

Prepared: 2026-08-22; uploaded to the production listing under review on
2026-08-23

Rechecked 2026-09-16: PNG dimensions, color types, and artwork byte sizes below
match the local files; all eight composed images were visually inspected.
The public listing has eight screenshot entries. “Current” in the August
capture record means current on August 22, not verified against store build 23.
Capture-to-build provenance and an installed-build visual comparison remain
outstanding; preserve these files as the dated asset set until refreshed.

## Ready assets

| File | Validated properties | Intended Console slot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `play-store-icon-512.png` | 512 × 512 PNG, RGBA, 66,136 bytes | Play Store app icon |
| `feature-graphic-1024x500.png` | 1024 × 500 PNG, 24-bit RGB/no alpha, 628,561 bytes | Feature graphic |
| `feature-graphic-source.png` | 1774 × 887 PNG, 24-bit RGB, 1,331,531 bytes | Retained generation source; do not upload instead of the exact-size file |

The icon was resized from the repository's official Dayova app mark. The
feature graphic was AI-generated from the same brand mark, then cropped/resized
and converted to the Play-safe RGB PNG above. Visual inspection found a clean
white/pale-blue composition with the Dayova Y, a learning path, checks, a
calendar, and books; it contains no promotional text, price, rating, device
frame, or store badge.

Generation brief preserved for provenance:

> Create a polished Google Play feature graphic for Dayova, a calm German
> learning-planner app. Use the provided official Dayova Y mark faithfully as
> the dominant brand element. Make a wide 2:1 composition on a white and very
> pale icy-blue background, with a subtle flowing learning path and restrained
> educational symbols such as check marks, a calendar, and books. Keep it
> premium, spacious, friendly, and crisp. No words, letters beyond the logo,
> slogans, prices, ratings, device mockups, app-store badges, or gradients that
> reduce legibility. Output a clean raster suitable for cropping to 1024 × 500.

The generated source itself is retained so the exact visible result—not prompt
text alone—is the authoritative provenance artifact.

## Ready phone-screenshot set

Upload the eight files in `screenshots/phone/` in filename order. Every final
file is a 1080 × 1920 portrait, 24-bit RGB PNG with no alpha channel. The
benefit header occupies less than 20% of the canvas; the rest is current,
readable Android UI without a physical device frame.

| Order | File | Product coverage | Suggested Play alt text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `01-dein-naechster-lernschritt.png` | Home, weekly context, next learning action | Dayova home screen showing Lea's next biology learning step and weekly progress. |
| 2 | `02-lernplaene-die-sich-anpassen.png` | Plan overview, exam date, progress | Dayova plan overview with a biology exam, adaptive next topic, duration, and remaining days. |
| 3 | `03-dein-weg-bis-zur-pruefung.png` | Populated learning path, completed and upcoming steps | Dayova learning path showing the next mitosis and meiosis session and the route toward the exam. |
| 4 | `04-aktiv-lernen.png` | Active learning session and question formats | A Dayova learning session with a multiple-choice biology question about mitosis and meiosis. |
| 5 | `05-direktes-feedback.png` | Immediate evaluation and ideal answer | Dayova feedback screen explaining a correct answer and showing the ideal answer. |
| 6 | `06-staerken-und-luecken.png` | Topic-level analysis and evidence statuses | Dayova analysis listing biology exam topics with evidence labels and answer counts. No learning gap is visible in this capture. |
| 7 | `07-lernzeiten-die-passen.png` | Weekly learning availability | Dayova learning-time settings with Monday and Wednesday availability. |
| 8 | `08-stundenplan-verbunden.png` | School timetable and class details | Dayova timetable with an active Monday mathematics class, room, and lesson times. |

The matching lossless 1280 × 2856 captures are retained in
`screenshots/source/`. They were captured on 2026-08-22 from the current-source
Android app in German using one synthetic learner, Lea, with a consistent
biology exam, timetable, availability, learning path, session answers, and
analysis. The Expo development tools button was disabled and Android System UI
demo mode supplied a clean, consistent status bar. No personal user data is
present.

The app UI is genuine and was not generated or redrawn. Only deterministic
cropping, scaling, a rounded presentation card, and concise German benefit
headers were applied by `../scripts/compose-screenshots.cjs`. The website's
older iPhone-framed product images were intentionally not reused.

## Final asset QA
