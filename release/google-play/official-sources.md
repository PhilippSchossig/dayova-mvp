## Reconciliation sources — 16 September 2026

- [Expo rollback guide](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/rollbacks/) and local
  `eas-cli@18.11.0` help for `update:rollback`, `update:republish`, and
  `update:roll-back-to-embedded`: verified command names and supported arguments.
- [Google testing guidance](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9845334)
  and [publishing states](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859751):
  submission/approval does not guarantee immediate tester availability.

  Vertex AI/R2 processing, and remaining release-behavior reconciliation.
- [DAY-216](https://linear.app/dayova/issue/DAY-216): historical production GeoIP
  ingestion and unresolved verification; not a new production traffic audit.
- [DAY-248](https://linear.app/dayova/issue/DAY-248): owner-reported store
  availability and exact native-release reconciliation.
- [DAY-414](https://linear.app/dayova/issue/DAY-414): both-platform exports and
  guarded publication required before production baseline activation.
- Authenticated EAS `build:view` for Android build
  `b8c2cdc4-076f-4569-90e2-6135fdb4bbe8`: metadata fields and verification limits
  are recorded in the [candidate audit](./release-candidate-audit.md).
- Signed-in Play Console, App Store Connect, RevenueCat, Expo, public Play and
  Dayova pages, and Production PostHog settings were subsequently inspected.
  Exact links, observed facts, material contradictions, and unverified items
  are recorded in the [live verification](../live-verification-2026-09-16.md).
